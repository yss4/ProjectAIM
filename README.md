ABET Information Manager
===========================
Semester-long team project in Software Engineering course (CSE308) at Stony Brook University.

My role:
I was in charge of intersection development like handling form datasets in order to import them into database by using J2EE and simple javascript code. Most of JSPs and servlets are made by me.

Links of JSP files:

Our pages are implemented using JSPs. To explain briefly for each create.jsp, user creates some information, then JSP will be redirected to the corresponding servlet file with the bean (object containing the information).

Links of servlet files :

In servlets, they first check if its function is get, post, or put. And they carry out the operation based on each http request.
